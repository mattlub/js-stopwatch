# js Stopwatch
-------------------
js Stopwatch is a basic javascript stopwatch I created. Try it out!

##### Motivations
-------------------
I wanted to practise using vanilla js to make make a responsive app, which required some not-completely-elemental
business logic. The result is quite good but also a little messy, as I wasn't thinking much about structure 
and modulising(?) at the time.

##### Planned Improvements
-------------------
- add lap button (DONE)
- style it up
- make it a more modular app
- maybe combine buttons, e.g. start/stop, lap/reset
- export lap times to csv
- mobile friendly/mobile first
- add tests 

##### Collaboration
-------------------
Any collaboration/comments are more than welcome
