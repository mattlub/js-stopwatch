# js Stopwatch

js Stopwatch is a basic javascript stopwatch I created.
Try it out [here](https://mattlub.github.io/js-stopwatch/)


### Motivations
I wanted to practise using vanilla js to make make a responsive app, which required some not-completely-elemental
business logic. The result is quite good but also a little messy, as I wasn't thinking much about structure 
and modulising(?) at the time.


##### Planned Improvements
-------------------
- [x] add lap button (DONE)
- [x] style it up (DONE initially 15/11/16)
- [] make it a more modular app
- [] maybe combine buttons, e.g. start/stop, lap/reset
- [] re-structure bottom half of watch to have buttons and lap times side by side
- [] export lap times to csv
- [] mobile friendly/mobile first
- [] add tests 

##### Collaboration
-------------------
Any collaboration/comments are more than welcome.
